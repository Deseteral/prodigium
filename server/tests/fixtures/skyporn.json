Many subreddits feature lists of &amp;quot;similar subreddits&amp;quot; that will help you find other awesome places to subscribe to. Looking for a subreddit but you just don&amp;#39;t know its name? Try &lt;a href=\"/r/findareddit\"&gt;/r/findareddit&lt;/a&gt;!

The mods are volunteers who ensure the subreddit stays true to its purpose by enforcing set rules. For example, &lt;a href=\"/r/android\"&gt;/r/android&lt;/a&gt; is a subreddit dedicated to discussion of the Android operating system. Anything not directly related to Android is removed by its moderators. Similarly, &lt;a href=\"/r/apple\"&gt;/r/apple&lt;/a&gt; is a subreddit dedicated to discussing Apple and its products.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moderators have the power to approve or remove any comments or submissions made to &lt;em&gt;only the subreddits they moderate.&lt;/em&gt; They can also issue a ban for users on their subreddit.

Be familiar with these rules. Failure to follow these rules may earn you a &lt;strong&gt;sitewide ban&lt;/strong&gt;, or the closing down of a subreddit.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;What is reddiquette?&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette\"&gt;reddiquette&lt;/a&gt; is an &lt;strong&gt;informal&lt;/strong&gt; set of guidelines to follow before commenting or submitting on reddit.

Many, many posts are made with the intention to spam or harass other users. Other posts just don&amp;#39;t fit the subreddit. Moderators have to filter through these posts every day to ensure their subreddit stays on topic and free of hostility. Some moderators use bots to help them report posts, some moderators do it all themselves. Every subreddit is different. If you find your post not showing up in the subreddit, your best bet is to ask the moderators there why it&amp;#39;s not showing up. &lt;em&gt;Please note: when you message the moderators, ALL moderators can read it!
